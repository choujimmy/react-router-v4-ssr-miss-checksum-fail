# React Router v4 <Miss> Server Side Rendering invalid checksum

When using `<Miss>` with server side rendering, missed routes result in invalid
checksum warning from React.

This repo is composed of the [Miss (No Match Handling)](https://react-router-website-xvufzcovng.now.sh/no-match-handling) and [ServerRouter](https://react-router-website-xvufzcovng.now.sh/ServerRouter) examples from the [React Router v4 docs](https://react-router-website-xvufzcovng.now.sh/).
